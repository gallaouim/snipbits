Itâ€™s really nice to know whether or not an item is contained within your array.
There is too many ways to detect if an Array in javascript contains a specific Value,
my favourite on is that we can check this array using the `includes()` function .

for example:

```js
[1, 2, 3].includes(1); // true
```
